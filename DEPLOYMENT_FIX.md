# Backend & Frontend Deployment Fix

## Problem

Production deployment shows "API კავშირი ვერ მოხერხდა: Network Error" because:

1. Frontend tries to connect to localhost:5000 in production
2. CSP blocks external connections

## Solution Steps

### 1. Backend Deployment (Vercel)

1. Deploy backend to Vercel
2. Set environment variables:
   ```
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://your-cluster.mongodb.net/korter_production
   JWT_SECRET=your_64_character_secret_key
   NODE_ENV=production
   CORS_ORIGIN=https://your-frontend-domain.vercel.app
   ```

### 2. Frontend Configuration

Frontend is already configured to use `/api` in production (relative URLs).

### 3. Full URL Structure

- Frontend: https://korter-clone-nfa2j65ts-lukametrs-projects.vercel.app/
- Backend: https://your-backend-deployment.vercel.app/
- API calls: Frontend will use relative URLs like `/api/properties`

### 4. Test URLs

After backend deployment, verify:

- https://your-backend-deployment.vercel.app/api/health
- https://your-backend-deployment.vercel.app/api/properties

## Current Status

✅ Frontend builds correctly  
✅ Relative API URLs configured  
⏳ Need backend deployment to Vercel  
⏳ Need MongoDB Atlas setup for production

## ✅ ISSUE RESOLVED

### Problem Analysis

The `/api/api/...` URL duplication was happening because:

1. Frontend was using cached build from previous configuration
2. API base URL was set to `/api` but some calls were still using `/api/...` paths

### Solution Applied

✅ **Fixed API configuration** - All API calls now use relative paths  
✅ **Rebuilt frontend** - Fresh production build created  
✅ **Verified build output** - No `/api/api/` URLs in compiled JavaScript

### Current Build Status

- **Build file**: `client/build/assets/index.DtrH_D2V.js`
- **API calls verified**: All using correct `/api/...` format
- **No duplication found**: Grep search confirmed clean URLs

### Next Steps for User

1. **Redeploy frontend** to production (Vercel will pick up latest build)
2. **Clear browser cache** (Ctrl+Shift+R)
3. **Test image upload** and property creation

The API URL duplication issue is now completely resolved in the codebase.
